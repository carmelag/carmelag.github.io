### Introduction to my portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio website created with the [static site generator Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It's hosted on GitHub Pages but you can visit it at my custom domain [www.carmelagreco.dev](https://www.carmelagreco.dev/)

I used the [Jekyll doc theme](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/) and played with it to adapt the pages to my needs.

There are *3 main sections*:
1. Technical writing samples
2. Contributions to open-source projects documentation
3. List of articles I published on Medium
