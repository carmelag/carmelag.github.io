You will listen your interlocutor, only if the headphones icon in the second column (_Any input_) is red. Indeed by selecting this icon you can switch on/switch ogg the monitoring for the Skype input. That means: listen or not your interlocutor.

When using Mixlr, we suggest to use headphones, so that you won't hear the voice back from the computer speakers.
Volumes regolation can be performed within Mixlr. You can change the volume in each column. Recommended volumes are suggested by white lines and they allows to avoid most of disturbs.
