Open Skype application on your computer and look for the setting item “Audio and video”
Within the "Speaker" section, choose on the dropdown menu the "AudioLink" item.

From now on, if you call someone on Skype, you cannot hear his/her voice, because the audio is "caught" by Mixlr using AudioLink. 
(If you want to revert Skype to normal use, set speakers setting to "Build-in output")

The setting procedure discussed so far, should be performed only once, during the first Mixlr setup.
